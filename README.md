# plaso2graph


Plaso2Graph is a tool to convert the output of plaso into a graph format. It takes as input the format "json_line" from plaso outputs and gives an extract to visualise the data in neo4j.

## Why use plaso2graph ?

In Forensic Investigation, it can be hard to visualise the data and understand the timeline of events and gain general insight of the investigation. Plaso2Graph, like the name suggest, convert the output of plaso, a famous tool for timeline analysis that handles a lot of artefacts, into a graph format that can be visualised in a graph database.

To be able to visualise the data helps to understand links between Process, Users, Computer, etc. 
However the project is dependent of what artefacts Plaso can parse, so it is not a complete solution to visualise all artefacts.

## Usage

```
Usage of ./plaso2graph:
  -output string
    	Output Json File (default "output/output.json")
  -source string

```

This tool takes as input the format "json_line" from plaso outputs and gives an extract to visualise the data in neo4j or maltego.

## Tech Choice

###Â Why Plaso ?

We use Plaso as input because it parse a large collection of artefact and order them into a timeline, this provide us a standard and easier way to process artefacts and also make simpler the merge between artefacts.

For example, a process execution may create an Evtx log, a prefetch and a SRUM artefact, the fact that __Plaso__ order the artefact by their timestamp make those artefacts close in the file and let us merge them without rereading the entire array.

## Entity and Artifacts Supported

This parts lists all Entities and associated artefacts extracted from Plaso, this is also a kind of Todo List.
